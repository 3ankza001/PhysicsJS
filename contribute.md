# Contribute

PhysicsJS was made to be extendable and modular. My hope is to receive
community contributions of different `behaviors`, `bodies`, `renderers`, etc...

You can read more about extending PhysicsJS by visiting the 
[wiki and reading the documentation][wiki].

I'm also looking for developers with any experience in building physics
engines to help resolve some of the issues. Contact me by
[email](mailto:jasper@wellcaffeinated.net) or
[twitter](https://twitter.com/wellcaffeinated) if you're interested!

Of course all contributions are welcome. You can submit pull requests
and open bug reports on [github][github].
