# Contribute

PhysicsJS was made to be extendable and modular. My hope is to receive
community contributions of different `behaviors`, `bodies`, `renderers`, etc...

You can read more about extending PhysicsJS by visiting the 
[wiki and reading the documentation][wiki].

Of course any contributions are welcome. You can submit pull requests
and open bug reports on [github][github].
